/*
 * The shard key determines the distribution of the collection’s documents among
 * the cluster’s shards. The shard key is either an indexed field or indexed
 * compound fields that exists in every document in the collection.
 */

/*
 * MongoDB partitions data in the collection using ranges of shard key values.
 * Each range defines a non-overlapping range of shard key values and is
 * associated with a chunk.
 *
 * MongoDB attempts to distribute chunks evenly among the shards in the cluster.
 * The shard key has a direct relationship to the effectiveness of chunk
 * distribution.
 *
 * Once you shard a collection, the shard key and the shard key values are
 * immutable; i.e.
 *  - You cannot select a different shard key for that collection.
 *  - You cannot update the values of the shard key fields.
