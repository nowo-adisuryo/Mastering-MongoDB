/*
 * The ObjectIds is automatically created by mongoDB. Its nature is immutable,
 * unique, bson datatype, 12 byte value.
 *
 * - Immutable mean when ObjectId is created, it cannot be modified or altered.
 * - Unique : ObjectId is combination of time (when its created), host name,
 * process id, and incrementing number.
 *
 * Why use complex id such as ObjectId for primary key?
 * Since mongoDB is used in a large cluster environment, when we host mongoDB
 * database in different machine, different server, ObjectId will ensure the
 * primary key is unique.
