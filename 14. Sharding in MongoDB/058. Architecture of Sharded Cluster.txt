 * Sharding Architecture.
 * Client app want to communicate with sharded data. It cannot directly
 * accessing the sharded data. It must communicate with mongos first.
 * The mongos then will look to the config servers, and then the config
 * servers will connecting mongos with sharded data.
 * Note: We can have multiple mongos.

/*
 * How the mongos will be knowing data/documents store in the sharded data? This
 * is done through the collection level.
 * The mongos will look for the "shard keys" for finding the right documents
 * to fetch. The "shard keys" must be available in all collection.
