/*
 * Replication is a process of duplicating data. The duplicated data is called
 * replica set.
 * Why we need replication?
 * - Availability of the data : If our server is down, then users can fetch
 * data from another server.
 * - Disaster Recovery/Backup
 * - Redudancy
 * - Reporting
 *
 * Advantages of using replication:
 * - Availability
 * - Data locality
 * - Read frequency
 * - Fault tolerance
