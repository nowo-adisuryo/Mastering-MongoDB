/*
 * What is data modelling?
 * Data modeling is the process of documenting a complex software system design
 * as an easily understood diagram, using text and symbols to represent the way
 * data needs to flow. The diagram can be used as a blueprint for the
 * construction of new software or for re-engineering a legacy application.
 */

/*
 * Key of data modelling :
 * - Structure of documents.
 * - Relationships between data.
 */

/*
 * Tools to represent the relationships :
 * - References : We can reference another document in a document.
 * - Embedded Data : We can embed a document inside a document.
