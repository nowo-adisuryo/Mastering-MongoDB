 * Election is used when we need to choose new primary data. Why we need to
 * choose new primary data? We need to choose new primary data because our
 * old primary data is cannot be accessed by the secondary data.
 *
 * Only primary data that can use write operation, the secondary data only can
 * use read operation.
 *
 * When secondary data is cannot read from primary data, this is mean something
 * wrong happened to the primary data, then primary data need to be changed.
 * Its time for secondary data call for election.
