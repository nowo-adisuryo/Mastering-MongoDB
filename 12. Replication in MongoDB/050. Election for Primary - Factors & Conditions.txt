 * There are two scenarios that will trigger the election.
 * 1. Primary data cannot be accessed by the secondary data.
 * 2. Primary data cannot accessed most of secondary data.

/*
 * 1. Primary data cannot to be accessed by the secondary data.
 * Primary and secondary data will send a heartbeat (pings) every 2 second, when
 * there is no response from primary data in 10 second, then eligible secondary
 * will call the election.
 */

/*
 * 2. Primary data cannot accessed most of secondary data.
 * When primary data is only connected to a few secondary data, then the
 * secondary data who can connected to the most other secondary data will

 * Replication election protocol. This is the protocol replica sets should
 * follow. This is how the protocolVersion: 1 worked.
 * If a replica set member is not having priority to participate in the election,
 * then it cannot following the election. Member priority need to be set to 1,
 * for participating in the election. The secondary member with the highest
 * or lowest priority can call an election. Highest priority that a
 * secondary member had, highest chance for that secondary member to winning
 * the election and so forth. If the priority is 0, then the member cannot
 * participating in an election.
 *
 * Note: We can use another data center for storing secondary data/replica set.
